# Authorize

Authorizations are based on identities as well.
We can authorize different identities for different services,
but for this quickstart guide, we're just authorizing our current machine to connect to itself.

```bash
$ carrier identity
oWDw4B1f88jiGj71qMCYTL8RCCdpRYfgbSNXQSDVByRVHV9
$ carrier authorize oWDw4B1f88jiGj71qMCYTL8RCCdpRYfgbSNXQSDVByRVHV9
$ carrier publish
...

```
