# Installing Carrier

Head over to <https://github.com/devguardio/carrier/releases>
and download the latest binary for your platform.

Suggestion: Rename the download locally to just "carrier"
Depending on your OS, copy them to a location within your PATH. This is usually /usr/bin,
but you may want to add them to your home directly and instead change your PATH variable.
